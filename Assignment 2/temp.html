  <p id="5jCniU">Nintendo has announced <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> for smartphones, due for release on iOS and Android in late November. The title looks much like other games in the <em>Animal Crossing</em> series, which traditionally see your character moving to a new location, interacting with the animal inhabitants, and customizing your home. This time around there's a camping theme, though — you're building up a campsite, which could make it seem a little smaller scale than the cities and towns in the full console releases. </p>
<p id="fCFwV8">The main focus of <em>Pocket Camp</em> appears to be crafting furniture from materials found in various areas, and your camper van home is as customizable as you'd expect. You're able to meet up with other players from your friends list and...</p>

<p id="gvqUFI">The SP-3 is the first to use the new Instax Square film, but it otherwise works much like its predecessor, the SP-2 (which prints Instax Mini film). That’s for better and for worse. Better because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/7/2/12072248/fujifilm-instax-share-printer-review-smartphone">the SP-2 worked well</a> — it printed fast (about 10 seconds), was easy to use with all sorts of different phones and services (like Facebook or Instagram), and the print quality was pretty...</p>

It won’t affect the music you’re playing, but it will add some floating spores and a flashlight beam to make your listening experience a little creepier.</p>
<p id="TCoPAm">Triggering the Easter egg is pretty simple: just open the Spotify, play the <em>Stranger Things</em> soundtrack for either season, and let it play. Wait a few seconds, and you’ll enter the home of the Demogorgon. If you move your mouse or browse around Spotify, however, it’ll disappear. </p>
