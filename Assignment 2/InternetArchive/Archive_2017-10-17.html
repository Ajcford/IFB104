    <title>Qualcomm performs first 5G test on a mobile device, debuts 5G reference smartphone design</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LKirWOIkaFaYkMAMbOZt_8g9QKE=/0x48:2683x1837/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57156885/x50_modem_hand.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="PfX0T4"&gt;Qualcomm’s long march towards 5G took a few steps closer to reality today, as the company has announced that it has completed its first test of a 5G connection on a mobile device. The test was completed using the X50 5G modem f&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/10/17/13306814/qualcomm-gigabit-5g-x16-x50-modem"&gt;irst announced a year ago&lt;/a&gt; and was performed on the 28GHz millimeter wave frequency band. Qualcomm says the modem achieved gigabit speeds in this test, but it is capable of 5Gbps speeds once full 5G deployments are completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rx7pa4"&gt;In addition, Qualcomm announced its first 5G smartphone reference design, which it will use to test 5G modems, radios, and networks with smartphone makers over the next year or two as they prepare to release 5G-compatible smartphones in the first half of 2019. The reference design is 9mm thick...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix plans to spend $8 billion to make its library 50 percent original by 2018</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C4u6VV60sSYhPwNcSSg4EN2hkdA=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57175359/Neo_Yokio_S01E01_16m29s23733f.0.png" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="6le32f"&gt;Netflix plans to increase the amount of money it spends on developing and producing original television and films next year, to an eye-popping $8 billion. The company has given a ballpark projection near that amount in the past, but Netflix bumped it up during its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/16/16485268/netflix-q3-third-quarter-2017-earnings"&gt;third-quarter earnings announcement today&lt;/a&gt; by an additional $1 billion to make clear to investors and Hollywood both that it plans spends to quite a lot of money to lock down ownership of its own entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7d1DP"&gt;With Disney and other high-profile names increasingly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/7/16267866/marvel-star-wars-disney-streaming-exclusives"&gt;moving content into closed garden ecosystems&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix’s future lies in making sure it controls its own destiny, and in ensuring it doesn’t take too big a hit when third-party content owners pull licensing deals out...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet’s Project Wing will send burrito drones to individual homes in Australia</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5vX-PNlCL9L_D4Wema2CKnlYmMQ=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57174769/alphabet_project_wing_1.0.jpeg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="a4AyPf"&gt;Project Wing, the drone delivery initiative of Google-owner Alphabet’s X lab, has partnered with two Australia businesses to further test its technology. In a new blog post &lt;a href="https://blog.x.company/testing-in-the-australian-skies-5a71db1ed6fe"&gt;published today on Medium&lt;/a&gt;, project co-lead James Ryan Burgess detailed the division’s recent progress toward bringing drone delivery to the masses, which has involved working with selected testers in a number of specialized markets. Last year, Wing launched a pilot program with the University of Virginia &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/8/12851384/alphabet-google-chipotle-drone-delivery-project-wing"&gt;thanks to a Federal Aviation Authority-approved partnership with Chipotle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hVzKK"&gt;Now, partnerships with two new businesses — a Mexican food chain called Guzman y Gomez and pharmacy chain Chemist Warehouse — mark the first time Wing’s drones will be delivering third-party...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HTC U11 successors could be announced November 2nd</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZSuXE1hiLqGj92l8c_F4_84bTYg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57174657/htc_u11_globe_vlad1.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="i8iYnp"&gt;HTC is holding an event on November 2nd, where it could announce two new versions of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/9/15767832/htc-u11-review-smartphone"&gt;its U11 smartphone&lt;/a&gt;. The company &lt;a href="http://phandroid.com/2017/10/16/htc-u-event-2017/"&gt;sent out invitations&lt;/a&gt; for an event in Taiwan to local media today, with the note including a large “U” at the top, indicating that the HTC U line will be the focus there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60aDBW"&gt;Over the past several weeks, leaks have come out suggesting there are two new phone models in the works: a mid-range device meant for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16339476/motorola-moto-x4-project-fi-android-one-smartphone"&gt;Google’s Android One program&lt;/a&gt;, and a higher-end device meant to stand up to the latest flagships. It’s not clear if both will launch on the 2nd, but it seems safe to assume that at least one of them will show up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WiqisR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A bigger, better U11 is on the way&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kI3EIL"&gt;The first of those is believed to be called &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/htcs-first-android-one-phone-will-rebranded-htc-u11-life-800166/"&gt;the U11 Life&lt;/a&gt;, which will be a...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DxO's detachable smartphone camera is finally coming to Android</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="GlPMkm"&gt;Two years ago, DxO — the company best known for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgeJ0XYuI2E"&gt;issuing scores for the best (and worst) smartphone cameras on the market&lt;/a&gt; — released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/18/8802377/dxo-one-iphone-camera-sensor"&gt;a curious little camera called the DxO One&lt;/a&gt; that plugged into the Lightning port of iPhones and iPads. Now that camera is finally coming to Android. DxO announced today that the company is launching a USB Type-C version of the One that should work with most USB-C Android phones and tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aM3f9"&gt;We don’t know much more about when the Android version will be available, how accessible it will be, what it will cost, or if it will be any different. (For what it’s worth, the current price of the original DxO One is $499.) DxO says more information is coming on November 2nd, and that the camera will be part of an...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook buys app that lets teens send each other compliments</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MNmRmnSkE_nyAUzzhE8GuLOUEpI=/356x0:1301x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57173261/21055997_250733995435408_2458921714328713338_o.0.png" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="9YGM2i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://tbhtime.com/news/"&gt;Facebook has acquired tbh&lt;/a&gt;, an iOS app that’s popular among teens for delivering compliments. The company is allowing tbh to operate as it did before, which is similar to how other Facebook acquisitions, like WhatsApp and Instagram, are run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crZss0"&gt;Tbh lets you send prewritten compliments to friends, a method aimed at preventing people from writing nasty comments and cyberbullying. According to tbh, which stands for “to be honest,” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Ftbh%2Fid1200014540%3Fmt%3D8" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;over 5 million people have downloaded the app&lt;/a&gt; so far and sent over a billion messages since the app was launched in August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpeKd2"&gt;Although the app is popular with teens, it can be accessed by anyone. The app presents prewritten compliments like “Could win an Olympic gold medal for their eyeliner game” with four of your...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People are reportedly buying more iPhone 7s than iPhone 8s in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YwDmTw2Y478lHiz4dMV40kl7G4g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57172499/jbareham_170915_2000_0020.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="lPxgRH"&gt;More customers in the US are buying the iPhone 7 than the iPhone 8, according to a new report from KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh (&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone-research/u-s-buyers-favor-iphone-7-over-8-research-idUSKBN1CL1Z1?utm_source=Twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxzbI2"&gt;Apple hasn’t released sales numbers for the iPhone 8, but it’s beginning to look like the new phone has had something of a muted response since its release at the end of September. Notably, the iPhone 8 was still readily available on launch day, instead of the usual sold out numbers that have historically shown up for previous models.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbNOgv"&gt;There are, of course, a number of factors that could be contributing to the iPhone 8’s lukewarm sales: there are already reports that people are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/18/16329756/apple-iphone-x-8-availability-preorders-consumer-demand"&gt;holding out for the iPhone X&lt;/a&gt;, which could be cutting into the 8’s sales. Additionally, there is the simple...&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>With another strong quarter, Netflix’s share price hits all-time high</title>
    <content type="html">  
  &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1QNcFlrXXgwUp_OH_b9mxtDMxIs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57172375/akrales_170810_1743_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;



  &lt;p id="adOz2g"&gt;Netflix has had a run of strong earnings over the last year, driven by better-than-expected subscriber gains and relatively consistent profit. Investors like what they see, and the company’s stock has steadily climbed, closing today at an all-time high of $202 a share. But the company has also been forced to borrow large sums to cover the ever-growing costs of its original content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQmthX"&gt;The company continued its streak this past quarter, besting analyst expectations in terms of revenue and subscriber growth. The &lt;a href="http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/NFLX/5275932571x0x959841/8E7F87AB-2E5C-41DB-862B-E872EF39B039/Q3_17_Shareholder_Letter_COMBINED.pdf"&gt;company reported&lt;/a&gt; $2.99 billion in revenue and 5.3 million new subscribers, a record for third quarter growth. That breaks down to 4.45 million new international customers and 850,000 new additions in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VrC414"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix continues to...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;p id="MUMskJ"&gt;Keyssa, a startup &lt;a href="http://www.keyssa.com/"&gt;specializing in wireless data transmission&lt;/a&gt; that is backed by Nest co-founder Tony Fadell, has filed a lawsuit against Android phone maker Essential, according to a &lt;a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-keyssa-lawsuit/android-co-creators-startup-sued-over-connector-technology-idUSKBN1CL2OO?feedType=RSS&amp;amp;feedName=technologyNews&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=Social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+reuters%2FtechnologyNews+%28Reuters+Technology+News%29"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Keyssa has been around since 2009, and the company says it was in talks with Essential for 10 months or so to help provide the technology behind connecting Essential’s new Android handset with its planned family of accessories and smart home devices. The talks ended without an agreement, and Keyssa is now accusing Essential of trade secret theft. Essential began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/16/16155828/essential-phones-will-begin-shipping-within-a-week"&gt;shipping its new Essential Phone in August&lt;/a&gt; alongside a camera accessory that connects to the phone wirelessly. &lt;/p&gt;
